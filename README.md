## Hi welcome to the Tips and tricks part of my website.  here you can do many things like how to make a new account on windows without needing admin how cool is that!

## WINDOWS PASSWORD BYPASS

## Ever forget your password want to set up a new account without logging in well I've got the way for you 
#### all you'll need is a usb drive with windows instal media on it and of couse a windows machine.
#### also should be obvious dont do this on a machine you arent supose to use as in this guide you'll be able to make a admin account.
### BTW in this guide we will be using BIOS and UEFI and interchangeable words 


### STEP 1.
## restart or shutdown the computer. Next plug in the usb in one of the usb ports. After that turn on the computer and reapetalty hit f12 or delete (these are the most common buttons used to access the BIOS or UEFI.

### STEP 2.
## After you boot up to the BIOS navigate to where you can choose the boot order (often shown as boot priority and on the first page). To change the boot order you either drag the icon (this case should say the usbs name like sandisk) infront of your boot drive (its the farthest to the left drive). While if you have no icons you should be able to click on boot priority or one of the names to change it.
